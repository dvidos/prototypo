# prototypo

This project is an exploration of 
whether business semantics, 
in declarative form,
can allow the creation of a system,
and help bridge the gap between
product and engineering.

## example

Given the input in the `hello.dsl` file:

```
entity Customer {
  attributes {
    Fullname
    Address
  }
}
```

The system is to produce a prototype solution,
consisting of the following:

* A backend DDD service, with:
  * API, Entities, Repositories, Services, Controllers
* A frontend React service, with:
  * List screens with filters, search, backend calls
* A relational database schema
* A json schema for a NoSQL database
* Infra for async processing, with events generated by the database operations

All the above are currently spun up
under a docker environment, 
but later containerization shall 
allow executing in kubernetes and on VMs, 
on prem and on cloud.

## nursery

Given the difficulty of implementing both the solution
and the tool that generates it in parallel,
`nursery` was created, to first implement 
the intended solution, then to be used
for the tool output.
